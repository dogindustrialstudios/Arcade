  <h1>GUESS WHAT!!!</h1>
  <p1>  With the latest update to the Arcade, you can now play scrach game as well as indev games for free, no more dumb coins or passes, just the free experience that there used to be.</p1>
  <p></p>
  <p1>  Just to be clear Preamium Passes will not be leaving, the premium pass can be used by game developers, and if they want people to pay for there games with coins, then so be it.  There are no limitations if your a game Developer except your can't be the super easy coins farm, or coin give away.</p1>
  <p></p>
  <p1>We at Dog Industrial Studios, along with the creater of the Arcade, Dog12312 hope you like the change that has been made and hope to add more useful stuff later.</p1>
